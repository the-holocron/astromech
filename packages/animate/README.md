## Usage

```scss
// include all animations with 'animate' as the namespace
// calls all mixins and will include in CSS output
@use "@theholocron/animate/src" as animate;

// use all animations with a different base class
// calls all mixins and will include in CSS output
@use "@theholocron/animate/src" as animate with (
    $base-class: 'my-animation-class'
);

// include only a specific group of mixins
@use "@theholocron/animate/src/bounce as *";
// call the mixins from this group
@include bounce-back-forth();
@include bounce-out-down();

// use only a specific mixin
@use "@theholocron/animate/src/bounce/back-forth";
// call the mixin you want to use
@include bounce-back-forth();
// call the mixin you want, but override this animations base class
@include bounce-back-forth('.another-class');
```

Then copy the code below, swapping out the `<animation-name>` for one of the ones listed below. Add `.infinite` to keep the animation going on forever.

```html
<div class="animate <animation-name>">Text</div>
```

_The previous examples are only a sample of what utilities are available._

## Where to Find Documentation

The best way to find out what's available is to check out the [source code](./src/) or [tests](./test/) but you can also take a look at [the-holocron.github.io/astromech/animate](http://the-holocron.github.io/astromech/animate/) or the [README](./src/README.md) which have been generated by [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com) and [`sassdoc-to-markdown`](https://github.com/hidoo/unit-sass/blob/master/packages/sassdoc-to-markdown).

* [**bounce**](./src/bounce/README.md) - these animations come from the opposite direction listed in the class (named after the direction it travels) and go slightly past the target and then oscillating a bit giving it the appearance of momentum and bounce.
* [**fade**](./src/fade/README.md) - these animations are a bit more subtle.  They still come from the opposite direction listed in the class (named after the direction it travels) but they transition the opacity of the element instead.
* [**slide**](./src/slide/README.md) - these animations come from the opposite direction listed in the class (named after the direction it travels) with a smooth transition.

## How We Track Changes [![Keep a Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keep%20a%20Changelog-1.0.0-orange)](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

This project uses a CHANGELOG and [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. [Read more about changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## How We Version [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for its versioning providing us an opt-in approach to releases. This means we add a version number according to the spec, as you see below. So rather than force developers to consume the latest and greatest, they can choose which version to consume and test any newer ones before upgrading. Please the read the spec as it goes into further detail.

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
