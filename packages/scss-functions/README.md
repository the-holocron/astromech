## Documentation

The best way to find out what's available is to check out the [source code](./src/) or [tests](./test/) but you can also take a look at [the-holocron.github.io/astromech/functions](http://the-holocron.github.io/astromech/functions/) or the [README](./src/README.md) which have been generated by [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com) and [`sassdoc-to-markdown`](https://github.com/hidoo/unit-sass/blob/master/packages/sassdoc-to-markdown).

- [**accessibility**](./src/a11y/README.md) - check contrast to ensure its compliant, fix contrast, choose the best color to match a level of contrast, and more.
- [**color**](./src/color/README.md) - a set of functions that work with, on and/or manipulate colors.
- [**list**](./src/list/README.md) - a set of functions that deal with lists.
- [**math**](./src/math/README.md) - a translation of mathematical functions into (S)CSS.
- [**miscellaneous**](./src/misc/README.md) - various functions that deal with breakpoints and deeply nested maps and lists.
- [**number**](./src/num/README.md) - functions that manipulate numbers; check if a value is a number, within a bounds, etc.
- [**string**](./src/str/README.md) - any function that manipulates strings; input a direction and output the opposite, strip the unit suffix, replace parts of a string, and so on.

## How We Track Changes [![Keep a Changelog](https://img.shields.io/badge/Keep%20a%20Changelog-1.0.0-orange)](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

This project uses a [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) and [GitHub releases](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project. [Read more about changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## How We Version [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

We use [SemVer](https://semver.org/) for its versioning providing us an opt-in approach to releases. This means we add a version number according to the spec, as you see below. So rather than force developers to consume the latest and greatest, they can choose which version to consume and test any newer ones before upgrading. Please the read the spec as it goes into further detail.

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

* **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
* **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
* **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
